# lyceum.typ: academic book template in typst

`lyceum:0.1.0` is a `typst` template for a simple, single-part, single-volume academic book.

The book template offers a `pre-textual`-`text`-`post-textual` structure.

## Name

`lyceum` designates "a place where educational talks were given to the public", according to
[the Cambridge Dictionary](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/lyceum). Thus,
being a non-specific place (or instrument) for educational contents exchange, it seemed fitting
for a non-canonical name for a typst `@preview` academic book package name, since academic books
are primarily meant for educational content exchange.
