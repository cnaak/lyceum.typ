# lyceum.typ: academic book template in typst

`lyceum` is an academic book template in `typst`.

## Name

`lyceum` designates "a place where educational talks were given to the public", according to
!(the Cambridge Dictionary)[https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/lyceum]. Thus,
being a non-specific place (or instrument) for educational contents exchange, it seemed fitting
for a non-canonical name for a typst `@preview` academic book package name, since academic books
are primarily meant for educational content exchange.
